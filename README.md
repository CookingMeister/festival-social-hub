## Getting Started

### Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed (version 12.x or higher recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed
- Nodemon installed
- MongoDB installed and running locally or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster

#### Setting Up Your Project

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run: `npm install`

3. Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory. Add the necessary environment variables as specified in the .env.Example file provided in the project. For example:

```code
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdatabasename
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

4. Start the MongoDB server and seed the database

Ensure your MongoDB server is running. If you're using a local MongoDB server, you can start it with: `mongod`

Next, seed the database with the provided seed data: `npm run seed`

If you're using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your connection string in the .env file matches your cluster's connection details.

5. Run the application

To start the application, run: `npm start`

This will start the server on the port specified in your .env file (or port 3000 by default). You can access the application by navigating to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Development

For development, you might want to run the application in development mode with nodemon for automatic server restarts on code changes: `npm run dev`

Ensure you have `nodemon` installed globally or as a dev dependency in your project.
